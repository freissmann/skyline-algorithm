# Skyline-Algorithm
This is a possible example of the skyline algorithm based on a sorted binary tree.

# Problem
You are given a series of buildings and only the outer most line should of all buildings should be drawn. A building is defined by a string with the format [x1, x2, y1] where x1 is the start- and x2 the end-coordinate and y1 is the height.

For instance, the sequence of “[[1,7,2], [3,4,3], [5,7,4]]” results in the following skyline:

# Algorithm implemented
To be defined

# Open points
* Drawing mechanism not yet implemented
* Tree rebalancing, as in works case the tree is actually only a linked-list
* Needs test to ensure that all possible permutations of the addition order always result in same skyline
